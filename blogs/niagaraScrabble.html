            Hello everyone! This is my first blog post uwu<br><br>I had the opportunity to participate in the Niagara Falls International Open this past weekend. It is a scrabble tournament that runs every year, with 22 games over 3 days. I travelled with a friend and we stayed in a cheap motel for the duration the tournament took place. We also did not realise food would be so expensive, so we ended up eating subway and tim hortons (the cheapest places in the area).

            I got to meet Mack Meller, current world rank 1 scrabble player, and Josh Sokol, and took some cool photos. I did not realise Josh would be so tall, he looks like a giant in the image.

            Since this was my first tournament with NASPA, I was unrated, so the directors put me in division B. I had a lot of experience playing scrabble beforehand at the Toronto Scrabble Club, and the University of Waterloo Scrabble Club, as well as many, many online games. This led up to many uneven matchups with me being the overwhelming favorite to win.
        </p>
        <p>
            I managed to go undefeated on my first day, going 8-0. On my second day, I made a tracking error and lost my 12th game, putting my new record at 15-1. On the final day, I lost one more game, making the incorrect decision to play off MEW instead of exchanging tiles, leading to a janky rack I had to deal with for the remainder of the match. My final tally was 20-2, with a finishing spread of 1841 pts up. In my 10th game, I made a play I was very proud of, WEASELS forming 4 overlaps in different ways, which ended up scoring me 100 points on the dot. My finishing performance ended up winning me 550 dabloons.

            On the Tuesday back from the tournament, I made a spreadsheet with all my games archived, which you can view here to see how I played, along with my comments:

            <br><br>The next tournament I am planning to attend will be in Cambridge on June 21, where I coincidentially happen to be studying this term. Hopefully the division A players will not cause too much trouble for me, lol.
