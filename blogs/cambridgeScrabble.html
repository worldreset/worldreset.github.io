        <p style="font-size: 25px">Cambridge Scrabble Tournament</p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px; margin-top: -25px">June 26, 2025</p>
        <p>
            This past weekend I took part in the Cambridge Scrabble Tournament. I was unsure what to expect, and to be honest was a bit nervous going into a field with high rated opponents. I do think I underperformed compared to my previous tournament in Niagara, which was due to nerves and lack of experience playing in a high division.
            <br><br>As always, I created a document to organize my games and comments, which you can follow along with <a style="color:blue" target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fWmsi7i17Tnt5CZCr8_SlJfgAdEbbtsPXV26Sbc5yoY/edit?usp=sharing">here.</a>
            <br><br>My games before lunch did not go my way, and I lost all three. I faced very strong opponents including Arie Sinke, ranked 41st in North America. In my game against Arie I lost by nearly 300 points, yikes. I played the phony BARIA, and a phony bingo of OUTNAMES which was only valid in the CSW lexicon, neither of which stayed on the board. I did manage to bingo with BRAINIAC and TENACES, however my opponent landed the opening bingo of OUTPLAN followed by EYESIGHT and AMARETTI, both of which played to triple word scores.

            After the lunch break, I felt rejuvenated and ready to play my final four games. In the first game, I played Agnes Kramer, who was ranked well over 100 elo points above me. I managed to win, lucking into both blanks to bingo with BORNITES heading into the endgame where I drew a good set of scoring tiles. This allowed me to eke out a win, with JEU for 38 points followed by FEDEX for 32, winning by a slim margin of 17.

            I managed to win the next game as well in a spectacular fashion, my opponent had a winning endgame, however with only seconds on the clock, played a suboptimal move. I managed to win with the play of GRRRL from an ugly endgame rack of AGLRRR, followed by my simple outplay of AR, winning by 13 points.

           My next opponent was the toughest one yet; Christopher Sykes, ranked 33rd in North America. I was playing well up until a pivotal point in the midgame holding a rack of IIMNOS?. I played IMINOS, which was a horrid move for several reasons. Firstly, I had two valid bingoes on the turn: IONIUMS, and MISUNION. Additionally, I should have played shorter with a move such as OM to maximize my bingo odds, given I trailed by 50 points. Finally, IMINOS is not even a valid word, lol. IMINO is an adjective meaning containing an imine, which does not take an S. My opponent held the play, but did not challenge as it gave him the bingo of ANTLIONS which otherwise did not play. Sometimes all it takes is one mistake to lose a hard fought game.

            I won my final game, which put my record at 3 wins 4 losses. However, due to the strength of the competition, my rating only dropped by 2 points from 1567 to 1565. If there is anything I learned from this tournament, it would be to not let opponents intimidate me, and to be confident in my play regardless of who it is I am up against.
