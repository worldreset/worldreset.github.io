            I was invited to participate in an invitational this past Sunday. I had been informed by Caleb that the director needed an evener for the event. Obviously I was not going to say no. I arrived at noon, and games began shortly after.<br><br>
            I played Mad Palazzo in my <a style="color:blue" target="_blank" href="https://woogles.io/anno/DbbAitvy4pdkg9DpAJ6VBM?turn=31">first game</a>. The lights were slightly dimmed, giving the area a late-night-pub sort of vibe. The game got off to a great start with me drawing into the first blank and playing FABBEST, which baited out a challenge. From there, I was able to hold onto my lead by playing defense, winning by a solid margin of 153.

           My <a style="color:blue" target="_blank" href="https://woogles.io/anno/2t8R4LLSRdMSKCQa7ArnGB?turn=28">second game</a> against Maxim Panitch was <a style="color:blue" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/live/U53Xw_AZqfM?si=V4VGIJICvMdYvYE3&t=4818">livestreamed on Youtube</a>. It was my first time being streamed live, so I made sure to bring my best owo. The commentators found the similarity of our names quite amusing; Max Pan and Maxim Panitch. My opponent went first and opened with the bingo of OBELIAS, a species of marine hydroid. Shortly after, I missed difficult plays of N(OX)IOUS and FEED(BOX), but managed to rebound and meet Panitch's bingo of CREATOR(S) with my LOVESEA(T).<br><br>After my next bingo of OCELLAT(E), I still trailed by 62 points. My time pressure at this point set off a series of blunders; the poor positional play of YAG, and my miss of (AB)YING threw any hopes I had of winning straight into the firepit. My opponent executed an expertly played game with no inaccuracies and in the end, it was Panitch's game by a margin of 80. A quick postgame discussion and a handshake concluded the match.

           I was to face Caleb Pittman in the <a style="color:blue" target="_blank" href="https://woogles.io/anno/NmJPS68mA9hAfQJptfVKPk?turn=31">following match</a>, against whom I had a tournament record of 4-0. Caleb is a strong player, and I do not think these statistics reflect his actual performance. After my opening play of VETTED, I held the rack of AAFPRST hoping Caleb would give me an I to work with for the tasty PARFA(I)TS. To my surprise, Caleb played IRI(D) giving me exactly what I needed to respond with 102 points on my next turn. This was certainly an inaccuracy from Caleb, however a 102 point punishment seems... uhh, excessive.<br><br>Upon analyzing Caleb's game following the tournament, I noticed that he played very solidly. However, a tiny slip-up followed by a huge stroke of luck gave me just what I needed to win this game by 79 points, blehh. Winning this game brings my record against Caleb to 5-0. I'm recalling the Greek word "peripeteia" indicating a reversal of fortune, and I feel it looming large. Hey, I'm certainly not important enough for plot armour... (but keep reading)

            The <a style="color:blue" target="_blank" href="https://woogles.io/anno/PZu8Xfg6SLtgR7eXqz65cX?turn=28">next game</a> against Heather McCall was a close one throughout. My two biggest blunders were my bingo miss of DISENDO(W) followed by my overly defensive (and colorful) play of PI(N)K on a turn where I had 14 more points available. In the endgame, I noticed that she had a rack of OLEOS which played forming (PINK)S. To my shock, I realized I did not have any way to block this apart from D8 RE(I) which did not score enough. To make matters worse, none of my moves scored enough to withstand her outplay, leading to my 16 point loss. okjhbuhgfvgyt

           My <a style="color:blue" target="_blank" href="https://woogles.io/anno/DjPNwmf65uEdVmTpCcCuDf?turn=30">next game vs Morris Greenberg</a> was also <a style="color:blue" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/live/U53Xw_AZqfM?si=7LB7esNtuGGP8OWs&t=16210">streamed live</a>. My nerves got to me this game and I was not able to perform well under time pressure. I missed simple bingoes with a blank S including SCALENE and CLEANSE, which were must-find moves that lost me the game. My brain did not register the bottom row as being playable in, since I did not have an S to hook DURUM, forgetting the blank can become an S, eek. I should start bringing a Sharpie to these events to write on my blank tile for easier visualization, but something tells me the director may have some objections. Final tally, 315-407.

            In <a style="color:blue" target="_blank" href="https://woogles.io/anno/goB6DZmYSNDnvJSxFgGgCX?turn=31">my final game</a>, I was surprised to be matched against Caleb Pittman once again. I did not play to my standard in this game either, but as is common in my games against Caleb, managed to get bailed out by luck at just the right time. The evening show began with my miss of ALMNERS or ALM(O)NERS. However a few turns later, I crawled out of the wreckage and played ISOGONS using a blank O, the highest scoring bingo available. Unfortunately my bingo misses did not stop there, missing IN(T)RUDER approaching the endgame. Being low on time (a common problem of mine), I slapped down HIE with 8 tiles left in the bag, holding a leave of CEIU, hoping for the best. I was incredibly lucky that Caleb did not spot COR(T)INAS or CAN(T)ORIS, instead playing COR for 29.<br><br>My three-tile draw after HIE was the insane B, K, Z. This allowed me to play my highest ever scoring non-bingo in a tournament game of <a style="color:blue" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xebec">ZEB(E)CK</a> (!!) for an amazing 86 points. Caleb reasonably challenged the play, since he had no wins otherwise. I then played (K)I to block Caleb's highest scoring plays to the triple, followed by (HIE)D for a final score of 426-340 in my favour. Caleb and I later learned that ZEBECK is a kind of boat. Reflecting back on this game, I played very sloppily considering my two bingo misses and poor time management. Thank the stars for my victory, and to the existence of a Mediterranean ship with square sails steering me toward a 3-3 tournament finish with a spread of 128.
